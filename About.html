<div id="purpose">
    <h1 class="about_us">Purpose</h1>
    <p>Cinema-Connoisseurs aims to provide an authentic and unique style of movie
        reviews. Movie reviews often provide a way for critics to evaluate a movie overall
        worth and decide whether or they believe it’s worth recommending. The challenge of
        Cinema-Connoisseurs is developing a dynamic website that allows the user to log in,
        search for movies using the TMDB API as well as allowing the user to read and write
        a review. </p>
</div>
<div id="how">
    <h1 class="about_us">How</h1>
    <p>To develop this web application there were a number of tools that were used. Tools
       such as HTML, CSS, Axios, JavaScript and JQuery. To add all of the information about
       the films we are using a TMDB API  which allows for us to access a wide variety of films.
       This proposal outlines in great details how we’ll accomplish this aim, and what you
       as the consumer should expect from us. Let’s do this the right way.
    </p>

<div id="beliefs">
    <h1 class="inspiration">Inspiration</h1>
    <p> The inspiration for developing this web application was to make an improved
        version of the IMDB web application that allows uers to view information about films
        and read reviews on them. However, the user interface on the IMDB website is not appealing
        so our aim was to improve on that user interface as well as allow users to write their own
        reviews on films.
